## Welcome!
This is a mod that adds a few new roles. Currently, it includes the following:
#### Prince (Villager)
Learn that exactly 1 of 2 characters is Disguised.
#### Forager (Villager)
Pick 1 character:
Learn if they are a Villager.
#### Lunatic (Outcast)
I Disguise.
I might be Corrupted.
#### Turncoat (Minion)
I Disguise.
#### Legionary (Demon)
Game Start:
Most characters are Minions.

I Lie and Disguise.

## NOTICE
Every role added, regardless of alignment, currently uses Villager colours. Apologies about that, you should probably use ArtSwap to go in and change those.
